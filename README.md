Airbnb Price Analysis Project



Overview

This project aims to analyze Airbnb listings to gain insights into pricing strategies, factors influencing price variations, and market trends. By leveraging data analytics and visualization techniques, we uncover key patterns that can guide hosts in setting competitive prices and help travelers make informed booking decisions.

Objectives

Understand the key factors influencing Airbnb listing prices.

Perform exploratory data analysis (EDA) on Airbnb datasets.

Build predictive models to estimate listing prices based on various features.

Provide actionable insights through visualizations and reports.
